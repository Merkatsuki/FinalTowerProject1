  storyLeftPageText: "The sun had dipped below the horizon when it happened. A boy\u2019s
    voice, small and clear, broke through the hum of cranking arms. He stood at the
    base of the elevator, speaking to no one, or so it seemed.\r\n\u201CYou see,
    there\u2019s this thing about horizons,\u201D the boy said, his voice carrying
    up the shaft. \u201CThey only exist if you\u2019re there to see them. If no one\u2019s
    looking, they don\u2019t need to hide anything, right? I think that\u2019s what\u2019s
    so amazing about them. They\u2019re\u2026 like a secret the world keeps just
    for you.\u201D\r\nThe construct\u2019s sensors registered the boy\u2019s presence
    as a disturbance in the weight ratios. But there was something in his tone, something
    chaotic, unmeasurable, that captured its attention. It logged his words, storing
    them beside the stories and poems it had gathered over the years."
  storyRightPageText: "Moments later, another voice called out. \u201CWill, who are
    you talking to?\u201D A woman\u2019s voice, brisk but warm.\r\nThe boy grinned,
    glancing over his shoulder. \u201CMy new friend,\u201D he said, patting the side
    of the construct\u2019s frame. \u201CHe listens.\u201D\r\nThe construct didn\u2019t
    understand what it meant to be a friend. But for the first time, the words it
    recorded felt like more than data. They felt\u2026 important."
