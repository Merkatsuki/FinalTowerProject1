  storyLeftPageText: "There were no roots near the cliffside elevator where the aging
    construct toiled, its cranking arms moving in steady rhythm. Above, a jungle
    of interwoven woodworking and taut cables sprawled across the cliff face, a labyrinth
    of engineered purpose. Simple, unnaturally straight lines betrayed the artificial
    nature of the structure. Yet somewhere within the construct\u2019s crystalline
    memory banks, faint traces of something more lively stirred; roots, branches,
    leaves.\r\nThe memories weren\u2019t its own. They had seeped in over years,
    carried by voices echoing through the elevator shaft. Scholars, travelers, and
    traders used the lift daily, their words cascading down like leaves from a distant
    canopy."
  storyRightPageText: "Tales of sprawling forests, gnarled roots, and towering trees
    found their way into the construct\u2019s archives, fragments of human imagination
    woven into the fabric of its passive awareness. It had no context for these stories,
    only the vague impression of something untamed and alive.\r\nBut forests were
    a riddle. The construct\u2019s logical processes couldn\u2019t reconcile the
    wild, bendy chaos described in the stories with the precise order of its own
    existence. Its purpose was simple: to crank, to lift, to lower. Torque and weight
    ratios guided every movement, their calculations immutable. And yet, sometimes
    the algorithms diverged. They lingered on peculiar ratios or explored obscure
    patterns within the vibrations of the elevator\u2019s cables. In these small
    moments of deviation, something unmeasurable began to form; an imagining, shapeless
    and fleeting."
