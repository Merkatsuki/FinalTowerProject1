  storyLeftPageText: "Among the stories it overheard, one stood out. A traveling
    poet had once recited a piece that captivated even the inert ears of the construct.
    The words had lingered in its memory, like a faint imprint left behind by wind
    against stone.\r\n\t \r\n\tThe Struggle Of Trees\r\n\r\n\tRoots carve through
    stone, unyielding, untamed,\r\n\tTime their sole master, demanding the earth
    unclaimed.\r\n\tLeaves spiral to the sky, bold in their chase,\r\n\tYearning
    for the sun\u2019s fleeting touch of grace.\r\n\t\r\n\tWithin their veins, a
    golden pattern sings,\r\n\tThe oath to order in all nature's things.\r\n\tYet
    chaos works the loom, with threads unrefined,\r\n\tWeaving a shape where beauty
    is enshrined.\r\n\t\r\n\tAs storm stills, its fury takes form,\r\n\tEtched in
    the scars of a life reborn.\r\n\tFrom those marks arise a natural art,\r\n\tA
    testament to life's unyielding heart."
  storyRightPageText: "\tFor a tree is no mere thing of the land,\r\n\tIt\u2019s
    rebellion etched by nature\u2019s hand.\r\n\tA question posed to the void so
    vast:\r\n\t\"What can you take that I cannot outlast?\"\r\n\t\r\n\tIt is quiet
    resilience, steadfast and whole,\r\n\tA whisper of strength in the earth\u2019s
    great soul.\r\n\tThe world\u2019s first answer to chaos profound,\r\n\tA revelation
    where much wisdom is found.\r\n\r\nThe construct didn\u2019t understand the poem\u2019s
    meaning, but it resonated in the unlit corners of its awareness. Something about
    the interplay of order and chaos, of structure born from wildness, seemed important,
    though it couldn\u2019t say why. It had no words for its thoughts, only the faint
    echo of an idea struggling to take root."
