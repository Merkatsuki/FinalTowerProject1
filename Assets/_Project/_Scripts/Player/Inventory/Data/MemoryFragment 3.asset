  Description: "The Tension Between Precision and Dream\n\nThe construct had once
    believed perfection was found in the predictable arc of motion, the harmony of
    tensioned gears and counterweighted pulleys. Its arms had turned with practiced
    exactitude, each cycle a poem of pure function.\r\nBut now, a new variable had
    entered the system\u2014one without mass, formula, or definition. It called itself
    longing, though the construct had no checksum for that. Patterns of movement
    became less efficient. Timers drifted. And still, something felt right.\r\nIt
    puzzled over the inefficiency, running diagnostics in loops, yet always returning
    to the same conclusion: that perhaps perfection was not the goal. Perhaps even
    machines, in dreaming, yearned to be imprecise."
